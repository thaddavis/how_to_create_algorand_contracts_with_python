# TLDR

In this project, we are exploring how to setup files and folders on our computer for developing Python applications.

After learning about solid ways to organize files and folders for Python development we will transform the project into a boilerplate project for writing, testing, and deploying Algorand contracts on the Algorand Sandbox, TestNet, and MainNet using Python (with a little help from the Algorand Sandbox/Docker).
